# Cartea de bucate

Această aplicație reprezintă un figider în care adminul poate adăuga diferite alimente. 
The "Cartea de bucate" application serve as your own virtual inteligent fridge. Just like 
your fridge from home you have to fill it with desired or fresh bought ingredients.
Additionally to a normal fridge "Carte de bucate" tells you what recipes you can cook with 
the ingredients inside.

## Features

- Expiration date on every ingredient
- The user is notifyed if an ingredient has gone bad
- A wide range of recipes that you can cook with the items in your fridge
- Subscribers to certain foods get notify when a recepie is ready to be cooked

## Relaltionship between tables

Having just a few relations between tables is what makes this application perfect for 
an introduction for a full stack project.
The user table is missing because every user is on his specific local host. In the future 
the app could be upgraded for a specific user using a log-in method.
-Ingredients to Recipes: Many-to-Many. An ingredient can be found in more than one recipe
and a recipe can have more than one ingredient.
